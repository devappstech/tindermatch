# tindermatch
Match with people across the world programatically 

This is a pet project which will eventually:
- Accept an array of cities to find matches in
- Like recommendations from city until given the OK to move to another 
- Autorespond with a cute message after a match is completed
- Track how many matches are made per requests

All while refreshing a token if it expires and moving to a new city if matches are exhausted.
